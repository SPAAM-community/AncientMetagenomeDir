AncientMetagenomeDir is a community curated resource of lists of all published
**shotgun**-sequenced ancient metagenome or microbial genome-level enriched samples and libraries.

It is primarily meant to act
as a reference guide to help point researchers toward any relevant public data
for comparative analysis. It is hoped it will help researchers track growth and
development of the field of ancient metagenomics over time.

## What is it about?

These lists contain information of ancient metagenomic samples such as publication, sample name, sample type,
geographic location, dates and DOIs and other accession numbers to raw data
in establised sequencing data databases.

We define here 'metagenome' in a broad sense, primarily focusing any data where the whole DNA content is analysed and
explored. Examples for this are (but not limited to) ancient microbiomes (host associated metagenome),
ancient sedimentary DNA (environmental) and also samples used for ancient pathogen
screening (single genomes).

The lists also contain metadata about all sequencing libraries generated from the corresponding samples.

See the README of each list for more detailed
descriptions of the contents of each list. Further modification and expansion of
these categories can be proposed to the [SPAAM community](https://spaam-community.github.io)
for further consideration.

The purpose of this repository is _not_ meant to be a comprehensive set of all
metadata about every ancient metagenome, but the aim is to have a lightweight
set of minimal information but with sufficient links to original sources of
detailed information. Keeping the repository simple and lightweight will promote
continual updating of the lists over a long period of time. That said, we will
design lists as far as possible to follow larger database metadata
specifications e.g.
[MIxS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/mixs-checklists#MIxS_shared) for
compatibility.

Finally, we aim to make releases of this at regular intervals, and assign each
release a citeable DOI. Each release will also include a changelog to record all
additions and any corrections or modifications. Therefore researchers are free
to use the information in their own publications, as per the CC-BY 4.0 licence.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è A table for ancient anthropogenic metagenomes was
> included up until release v21.09 (TaputapuƒÅtea). However this was dropped in release
> "Pyu Cities" due to lack of interest from the community. It may be reinstated in
> the future.

### Citation

üìñ For **general** use of the project, please use the publication citation below.

For a specific _release_ citation (e.g. the version used for analysis), go to [Releases](https://github.com/SPAAM-community/AncientMetagenomeDir/releases) and use the DOI in the badge of the given release's description, or check the corresponding [Zenodo entry](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3980833)

Alongside the Zenodo ID of the release version, please also cite:
