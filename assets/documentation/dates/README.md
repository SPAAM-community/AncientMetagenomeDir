# AncientMetagenomeDir - Dates Column Specifications

![check_dataset](https://github.com/spaam-community/AncientMetagenomeDir/workflows/check_dataset/badge.svg)

This page describes the column definitions for the list of dated samples. Currently  it only applies to:

- ü¶†: host-associated ancient single genomes

Numeric fields (e.g. `delta_13c`), can be filled with `NA` to indicate 'no reported value'. Free text and non-numeric fields (e.g. `calibration_software`) can be indicated with `NR` for not reported, or `DNE` (does not exist) when not applicable.

All columns with 'defined categories' should be validated against `assets/enums/<column>.json`. This is to ensure data consistency, e.g. if the material used for dating is Bone, they all are listed as `bone` (as defined in `assets/enums/<column>.json`).

If you wish to add a new category, please consult with the SPAAM community, and then add it to `assets/enums/<column>.json`.

Dates columns are as follows:

## project_name
- Format: `SurnameYYYY` (YYYY in numeric format)
- Due to restrictions in regex (used for validation checks), **punctuation (e.g.
  hyphens or spaces) or characters with accents cannot be used**.
  - Use the non-accented version (e.g. √£ or √§ become a).
  - If the first author has multiple or hyphenated surnames, write them all
    together capitalising each surname.
- If a same author/year combination already exists, please append a single lower
  case character (b,c,d etc.) to the key.
  - The already existing key does not need to be updated. `b` indicates the
    'second' key added.
  - e.g. Muhlemann2018 (original), Muhlemann2018b (first duplicate),
    Muhlemann2018c (second duplicate) etc.
- If the authors re-used data from previously published studies that have not
  been added to AncientMetagenomeDir, please use the project name of the current
  study where metagenomics or microbial genomic analysis has been performed for
  all samples.
