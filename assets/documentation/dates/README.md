# AncientMetagenomeDir - Dates Column Specifications

![check_dataset](https://github.com/spaam-community/AncientMetagenomeDir/workflows/check_dataset/badge.svg)

This page describes columns definitions for the dates list. Right now it only applies to: 

- ü¶†: host-associated ancient single genomes

Numeric fields (e.g. `delta_13c`), can be filled with `NA` to indicate 'no
reported value'. Free text fields (e.g. `calibration_software`) can be indicated with `NR` for not reported or `NA` when not applicable.

All column with 'defined categories' should be validated against
`assets/enums/<column>.json`. This is to ensure data consistency, e.g. if the material use for dating is Bone that they all are listed as `bone` (as defined in
`assets/enums/<column>.json`).

If you wish to a new category, please consult with the [SPAAM
community](spaam-community.github.io), and then add it to
`assets/enums/<column>.json`.

Dates columns are as follows:

## project_name

- Format: `SurnameYYYY` (YYYY in numeric format)
- Due to restrictions in regex (used for validation checks), **punctuation (e.g.
  hyphens or spaces) or characters with accents cannot be used**.
  - Use the non-accented version (e.g. √£ or √§ become a).
  - If the first author has multiple or hyphenated surnames, write them all
    together capitalising each surname.
- If a same author/year combination already exists, please append a single lower
  case character (b,c,d etc.) to the key.
  - The already existing key does not need to be updated. `b` indicates the
    'second' key added.
  - e.g. Muhlemann2018 (original), Muhlemann2018b (first duplicate),
    Muhlemann2018c (second duplicate) etc.
- If the authors re-used data from previously published studies that have not
  been added to AncientMetagenomeDir, please use the project name of the current
  study where metagenomics or microbial genomic analysis has been performed for
  all samples.

## archive_sample_accession

- Of _sample_, where possible
- For ENA/SRA: These should be **secondary** accession IDs to keep as close to
  data as possible (e.g. SRS, ERS, not SAMEA - see below)
- If non-NCBI/ENA, use as close to sample-level as possible
  - e.g. for Dryad/Figshare, use the numeric ID after 'file_steam' in the per-file download URL
- Multiple can be separated with commas
  - e.g. when different extracts of one sample incorrectly uploaded as samples
