# Contribution checklists

## Contributing your own Publications

Contributing a new publication's sample information consists of the following:

- check under the
  [issues](https://github.com/spaam-community/AncientMetagenomeDir/issues) tab if
  the paper is already listed (if not, make one!)
  - check whether the issue has already been
    [closed](https://github.com/spaam-community/AncientMetagenomeDir/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
  - if it listed, check to see if there is already a [pull
    request](https://github.com/spaam-community/AncientMetagenomeDir/pulls)
    linked to it
- assign yourself to the issue
- check if site/samples have been published before (i.e. to ensure the same
  names are used for any new samples)
- making your own fork or branch of the repository
- update the given list (e.g. in spreadsheet program, R etc.)
  - generally you will be copying direct from a publication's supplementary
    information
  - some columns have standard pre-defined categories, check a lists's README if
    in doubt!
  - if you need to add a category please request one by mentioning
    @ancientmetagenomedir-coreteam in your PR, or update the enums in JSON files
    under `assets/enums` yourself
- making a pull-request
- receive a review to check your additions follow current conventions
- have your PR merged
- close the issue

All contributions are attributed through Git's in-built recording of the author
of each commit and pull request. These will be displayed publically in the
future.

## Contributing previously published publications

In addition to researchers adding their own publications, we will also maintain
lists of published but not-yet-added studies using github issues.

Therefore researchers who wish to contribute who do not yet have their own
publications, can 'assign' themselves to specific 'issues' (papers), and reduce
the risk of duplicates.

Contribution of these publications follow as [above](#own-publications).
